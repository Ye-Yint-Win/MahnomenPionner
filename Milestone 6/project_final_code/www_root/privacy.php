            <p>
                The Mahnomen Pioneer encourages letters to the editor with original thoughts and ideas of general interest.<br />
                Letters should be intended for publication in the Pioneer exclusively; letters sent to multiple publications<br />
                will generally not be accepted.
            </p>
            <p>
                The right is reserved to edit letters for length and clarity, or bad language, and to reject letters deemed<br />
                promotional or in poor taste. All letters must be signed and contain an address or phone number of the writer,<br />
                so authenticity can be verified. Author's name must appear in the letters published. Anonymous letters won't be<br />
                published. Please limit the length of the letter. We will accept only two letters per person or organization<br />
                pertaining to the same topic.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the campaign season, no negative statements against candidates will be allowed in letters to the editor.<br />
                If you wish to express your opinion, then be in support of the candidate whom you support, don't tear down the<br />
                other candidates. Each candidate is allowed to have one article or questionnaire published per year, and may<br />
                purchase ads as they wish. Please make arrangements with the publisher.

                In a time of sorrow, we respect the needs of the family to get an obituary published for their loved ones. We<br />
                format the obituary in a two column format. The first 2 col x 5.5‚Äù of space is given to the family as a gift. We<br />
                do not say free, because it is not free to us. The remaining space is charged at the column inch display rate.<br />
                We charge $10 for the use of a 1 column x 3 inch deep picture. We are able to edit, lighten, work with the<br />
                pictures you send us. Please send a digital version of the original picture, do not alter it. We will adjust. In<br />
                order to publish the obituary, we will need a billing address for the responsible party. The submission of the<br />
                obituary, picture, etc., is your promise to us to pay for the obituary. We keep it as economical as possible.
