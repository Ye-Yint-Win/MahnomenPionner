    <h1>Pioneer Policy: Letters to editor </h1>
    <p label="privacy" class="privacy">
    <p>
        The Mahnomen Pioneer encourages letters to the editor with original thoughts and ideas of general interest.
        Letters should be intended for publication in the Pioneer exclusively; letters sent to multiple publications
        will generally not be accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
        The right is reserved to edit letters for length and clarity, or bad language, and to reject letters deemed
        promotional or in poor taste. All letters must be signed and contain an address or phone number of the writer,
        so authenticity can be verified. Author’s name must appear in the letters published. Anonymous letters won’t be
        published. Please limit the length of the letter. We will accept only two letters per person or organization
        pertaining to the same topic.
    </p>
    <p>
        During the campaign season, no negative statements against candidates will be allowed in letters to the editor.
        If you wish to express your opinion, then be in support of the candidate whom you support, don’t tear down the
        other candidates. Each candidate is allowed to have one article or questionnaire published per year, and may
        purchase ads as they wish. Please make arrangements with the publisher.

    <p>
        In a time of sorrow, we respect the needs of the family to get an obituary published for their loved ones. We
        format the obituary in a two column format. The first 2 col x 5.5” of space is given to the family as a gift. We
        do not say free, because it is not free to us. The remaining space is charged at the column inch display rate.
        We charge $10 for the use of a 1 column x 3 inch deep picture. We are able to edit, lighten, work with the
        pictures you send us. Please send a digital version of the original picture, do not alter it. We will adjust. In
        order to publish the obituary, we will need a billing address for the responsible party. The submission of the
        obituary, picture, etc., is your promise to us to pay for the obituary. We keep it as economical as possible.
